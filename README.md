# Farmdoc


A web-based analysis tool to assist farmers, academics and policymakers 
with understanding programs and policies surrounding the farm bill

**farmdoc** is a React module that renders the front end of the Farmdoc dashboard,
exchange calls and data with the model backend. 

# Installation

1. Check that required JavaScript package manager `npm` and `Node.js` package 
are sucessfully installed on your computer

    `npm -v` and 
    `node -v`
    
	Recommended versions to be used are: node 10.x and npm 6.x.

2. If not download `Node.js` package from, for example 
[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install it on your system. 
Package manager `npm` is distributed with `Node.js` and it is automatically 
installed on your computer.

repository.

4. In the Project window terminal run 

	`npm install --python=python2.7`

	**Note** Some `Node` installation dependencies do not work with Python 3.x 
	therefore users with default higher version of Python have to specify lower 
	Python versions.
